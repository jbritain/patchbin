          This tool doesn't work without JavaScript. To be clear, it also
          doesn't track you, or mine bitcoin, or do anything nefarious. Don't
          believe me?
          <a href="https://github.com/jbritain/patchbin">Check for yourself.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          What it does do, though, is run all processing client-side. No data is
          ever sent to a server, because not only do I not want to pay the cost
          of hosting something like that, but I also think that there's no point
          in doing it that way if it's possible to do it on the client.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So, as much as it may pain you, if you want to use this tool, you will
          need to add this site to your JavaScript whitelist.

    <p>
      a utility for generating binary patches that can be used to reconstruct a
      modified version of a file without directly distributing that modification
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      if you are looking to generate a patch file to distribute, click the
      button at the bottom, upload the original file and your modified version,
      and click "generate patch". you can then safely distribute the downloaded
      '.bin' file without violating any licensing agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      if you have been given a patch file, upload the original file and the
      patch file, and click "apply patch".
    </p>
    <p>
      if you find this utility useful, consider

      lights on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >note: as this is a binary patch, the file being patched must always be
        exactly the same. in the case of a zip archive, if the metadata of any
        files within the archive is different (such as the last modified date),
        the patch will fail.</b
